    <p>
        I want to be very clear about what my critique is and what it's not.
        I don't, for example, believe that the diagonalization process itself is flawed.
        In fact, <em>I believe it's a good construction that illustrates something meaningful about type theory.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        You could say that my critique is in the conclusion of Cantor's proof, but this isn't exactly true either.
        It's the correct conclusion once you've accepted all the axioms of type theory,
        which clearly Cantor has.
    </p>

    <p>
        So obviously my critique is some subtlety about the axioms of type theory.
        Then why to I direct my criticism at Cantor especially?
    </p>

    <p>
        From my perspective, Cantor was the first to discover the self-contradiction in the definition of
        <span class="symbol">&naturals;</span>, which is the basis of his proof, yet he quietly accepted it,
        as did the entire mathematics community.
        This doesn't sit well with me.
    </p>

    <p>
        So in this article, I'll be describing this apparent self-contradiction, how it leads to "countable infinities",
        why I think this conclusion should not be accepted, and what I think can be done about it.
    </p>
