        1. Motivation: Designing Elegant Algebraic Systems
    </div>

    <p>
        Modern mathematics values axioms, and rightfully so. Axioms are the foundation of all structure and proof.
        Axioms define what symbols are, how they behave, and lead to rich emergent structure that can be exploited
        for their symmetries and practical consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
        There exists a vast library of research into the topic of axioms, how they are defined, how they can
        be employed for writing proofs, and how to detect if they are inconsistent.
        PEM (Principled Emergent Metatheory) addresses a separate are of concerns: the philosophy and elegance of
        a theory holistically, considering its axioms and resulting structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elegance is not an objective metric, and we don't attempt to define it as such.
        Rather, it's a human-observed pattern, a feeling of recognition that provides a basis of judgement
        even before we fully understand the implications, or even the problem space.
        Elegance can be misunderstood, but it's never "wrong" - something can be elegantly absurd or
        elegantly self-contradictory.
        What's important is not the substance itself - <strong>it's how that substance is defined, structured, and
        presented that creates the subjective experience of elegance.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may not be able to define elegance precisely,
        but we can define elements of it that people generally agree with.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arbitrarily assigned axioms written for no obvious purpose would be unlikely considered "elegant" by
        anyone's standards.
        Conversely, a single well-crafted, well-intentioned axiom resulting in rich logical structure would likely be
        appreciated, despite any other flaws.
    </p>
    <p>
        A theory that can be understood quickly and simply, without requiring an extensive background and training
        on the subject, would be considered elegant. Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 is an example of this:
        a few sentences can completely change one's perspective on the nature of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
        A theory involving many axioms resulting in a highly practical structure would be prized by its practitioners.
        A theory involving fewer axioms with the same applicability would likely be considered more elegant.
    </p>
    <p>
        A smaller quantity of axioms is not automatically elegant, however.
        A theory with copious axioms might still be considered elegant if those axioms are strongly cohesive,
        following a clear motivation and purpose. In this case, the axioms themselves might be considered
        emergent structure of some elegant foundational metatheory.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's the common thread in all cases?
        It's simplicity, cohesion, and emergent structure.
        So, fewer axioms is still the best metric
        (assuming the axioms are themselves elegant)
        but the qualifier is:
        can a collection of axioms be objectively reconstructed from a metarule,
        or do they feel like ad-hoc rules added of necessity?
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>PEM attempts to define a framework by which maximally elegant theories may be defined.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Objectivity in reconstruction is the ultimate hack for elegance.
        It means you can have a collection of axioms that count as a single axiom in terms of perceived elegance,
        again assuming the seed axiom is itself elegant.
        A metarule can depend on axioms (definitions, essentially), it can be axiomatic itself,
        or it can be defined informally. Elegance favors short, plainly-defined, well-motivated and justified metarules.

        1. Philosophical Foundations and Seed Concept
    </div>

    <p>
        Any elegant theory will have an elegant foundation.
        This seed, we call it, is a one-sentence description of the core intention, feeling, goal, motivation, or methodology
        of the theory.
    </p>

    <p>
        All axioms in an elegant theory should be chosen to directly enable, realize, or define supporting
        structure for the seed concept.
        No axioms are allowed without being chosen in direct connection with a seed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The seed needn't be defined formally. It's not an axiom itself - it's a statement of justification,
        a mini-manifesto, or the basis of thought experiment.
        You don't need to know what structures will emerge ahead of time.
